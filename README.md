This plugin provides a new window that will preview the Stop Motion
animation made from the photos of the current session.  The animation
plays indefinitely in loop.

It has been tested in Entangle version 0.6.0, which at the moment of
this writing is the latest.  [Go get it!](http://entangle-photo.org/).
