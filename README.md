This plugin provides a new window that will preview the Stop Motion
animation made from the photos of the current session.  The animation
plays indefinitely in loop.

It has been tested in Entangle version 0.6.0, which at the moment of
this writing is the latest.  [Go get it!](http://entangle-photo.org/).

## Usage

To bring up the preview window, go to the Windows menu and toggle
**Stopmotion Preview**.

To use it, first you need to install and activate the plugin.  See
**Install** instructions below.

## Install

Download the package [from here](<http://...>) and uncompress it to
your computer.

Open a console and run:

Start Entangle and go to Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins.  **StopMotion
Preview** should appear in the list.  Activate it.

Close the Preferences dialog and open the Windows menu.  If the plugin
